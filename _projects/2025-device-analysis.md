For my Thermodynamics course - MAE 2210 - we were asked to select a real-world instance of the devices we studied in the course, explain its functions, perform an analysis of the system with methods learned in the course, and discuss how changes in its operating conditions would impact performance.

A pressure washer nozzle is an interchangeable attachment for a pressure washing device, altering the outcoming stream flow to best suit the desired task. I will focus my analysis on Quick Connect (QC) nozzles. By industry standards, a QC nozzle is categorized based on the spray angle, that is the divergence of the fluid flow upon exiting the nozzle. Smaller angles produce more concentrated, powerful streams. Also by industry standard, they are color-coded by their spray angle, as outlined by the chart to left.
